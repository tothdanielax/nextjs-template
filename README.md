# Features

- üòä **NextJS 14** (App Router) with TypeScript 5.
- üöÄ **Vitest** for unit and integration tests with **React Testing Library**.
- üé≠ **Playwright** for end-to-end tests.
- üîç Configured **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting.
- üìö **Storybook** for component development.
- üé® **TailwindCSS** for utility-first CSS.
- üñåÔ∏è **ShadcnUI** for UI components.
- üõ†Ô∏è **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline with **CodeQL** and **Codecov** integration.
- üîó **Simple git hooks** and **Lint Staged** for pre-commit hooks to run linting and formatting without the need to manually run them or CI/CD pipeline.
- üóÑÔ∏è **Drizzle** for ORM. Configured for PostgreSQL.
- üåê **Next-Intl** for internationalization. Currently supports English and Hungarian.
- üì¶ **pnpm** as the preferred package manager. Used for CI/CD pipeline as well to use its superior caching mechanism.
- üê≥ **Docker** for local containerization. Drizzle is configured in a way to work with Docker in local development, but use Vercel in production.
- üîê **Zod** for schema validation.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Zustand** for state management.
- üåô **Dark mode** support via **Next-Themes**. This is also configured to work well with Storybook.

# Demo

The demo is deployed to Vercel. Available at: [https://nextjs-template-zq12.vercel.app/en](https://nextjs-template-zq12.vercel.app/en).

---

# Setup

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tothdanielax/nextjs-template.git
```

- Navigate to the folder. It can be done via CLI with:

```bash
cd nextjs-template
```

- Install dependencies (preferred package manager is 'pnpm'):

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Create '.env' file based on '.env.example' file (see [Environment Variables](#Environment Variables))
- Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm start:dev # you can also run it with 'pnpm start:dev-https' to start the LOCAL server with HTTPS
```

- Open [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) with your browser to see the result (if you didn't change the port, it should be 3000). Change http to https if you started the server with HTTPS.

# Environment Variables

The environment variables are stored in a `.env` file. The `.env.example` file contains an example for this. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` and change the values as you see fit.

The environment variables are validated via `zod` and the schema can be found in the `src/utils/env.ts` file (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs` package is used for this). The variables should be imported from `env.ts`, because it provides type safety.

The following environment variables are available:

| Variable            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default Value   |

# Comments

- The template is configured to work with PostgreSQL. If you want to use another database, you need to change the `drizzle` configuration in the `src/db/index.ts` file. You can find more information about the configuration in the [Drizzle documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/conf). You also need to change the `docker-compose.local.yml` file to use the correct database image. Environment variables and `src/env.ts` should be changed accordingly.
- Eslint v9 introduced flat configuration as the default one. The template will not support it until all of the plugins and configurations are updated to support it. <br>
  **Note:** Plugins should be updated carefully, because some of them transitioned to v9 with breaking changes/stopped supporting older versions. <br>
  **Note**: Before updating any rules check [Typescript Eslint - Performance](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/typed-linting/performance/).
- The template uses `pnpm` as the package manager. I recommend to use it, because I find it super fast.:) The CI/CD pipeline is also configured to use `pnpm`. If you would like to change it, you need to update the `pnpm` commands in the `package.json` file and the `ci.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory. Also the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file should be removed.
